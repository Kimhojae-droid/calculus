The trough in the figure below has width w=2 ft, length L=12 ft and height h=4 ft.   (Click on the graph for a larger version.) If the trough is full of water, find the force of the water on a triangular end. (Use the density of water =62.4 lb/ft3.) Force =  2995.2N  (include units)  Find the work to pump all of the water over the top of the trough. Work =   (include units)
